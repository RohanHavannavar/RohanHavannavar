### 💼 Professional Experience

- **Current Role:** Data Scientist @ **EY (Ernst & Young)**
- **Location:** India
- Enhanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbots by integrating reranker and hybrid search, achieving a 
33% improvement in context precision and recall (0.6 to 0.8) using Azure OpenAI, Azure Function App, and
Azure DevOps,GPT-4 32k context LLM Model, Azure OpenAI Embeddings and Langchain.
- Integrated and tested reranking models, including ColBERT and Cohere Reranker, with Cohere Reranker
demonstrating superior performance.
- Individually developed a chatbot for structured data, enabling text-to-SQL query conversion and retrieving results from
Azure SQL Database.
- Experimented with various prompt engineering techniques, including zero-shot, few-shot, chain-of-thought, and
tree-of-thought, with chain-of-thought and tree-of-thought boosting the NLQ chatbot accuracy by 10-20%.
- The Chatbot Enhanced availability and reduced 200–300 hours of manual effort monthly for Supply Chain and Finance
teams at a major FMCG client.
- Created a data pipeline in Azure Databricks to deliver data to the chatbot on diverse cadences (daily, weekly, monthly,
yearly), eliminating 20–30 hours of manual effort monthly and enhancing information flow and system responsiveness.


Data Scientist @ **Tata Consultancy Services (TCS)**
- Developed a modular, Python-based library for regression, classification, and forecasting workflows, installable via
pip with JFrog token authentication, enabling seamless integration into corporate environments.
- Engineered flexible modules for Dataset loading, data preprocessing, EDA, feature selection, feature
transformation, modeling, and reporting, supporting multiple processors (Pandas, Spark, Polars) with easy 
extensibility for future contributions.
- Designed and implemented AutoML pipelines using models from scikit-learn, sktime, and statsmodels, with integrated
MLflow and multiprocessing for efficient model tracking and performance optimization, supporting both local and Azure 
Databricks environments.
- Enhanced efficiency by reducing ad-hoc machine learning workflow development time by 10-20%, with built-in
hyperparameter tuning options for improved model performance.
- Created comprehensive unit tests with pytest, maintained version control via Git, and managed package dependencies
using Poetry, following OOP principles with decorators and Python protocols for robust, scalable code.
